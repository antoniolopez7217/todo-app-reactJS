# To-Do app with ReactJs

A simple app that keeps track of your to-do actions, you can add any number of tasks to it, click on the checkbox to complete the task, and filter using buttons to know the current status of the tasks.

All the notes will be stored on a local server, using *json server*, which is located in the file `db.json`

## :hammer_and_wrench: How to use it?

First of all, you need to install the packages with the command

`$ npm install`

Once you have all the packages installed, you will need to run the server, using

`npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json`

This will run the server contained in the file `db.json` and it will open in the [port 3001](http://localhost:3001/things) of your web browser.

In order to start the *"To-do app"*, you will initialize it with

`npm start`

The app will open automatically in the [port 3000](http://localhost:3000/) of your web browser
